## TrueFace Admin System

The TrueFace project includes an **Admin System**, a separate software integrated with the TrueFace API. This system provides the necessary tools for managing students, lectures, and teachers, ensuring seamless operation and ease of use for administrators.

### Setup

Before compiling the admin system, you need to configure the activation key in the `Configurations.py` file. This key is essential for system activation and API integration.

2. **Compilation Instructions**

Once the activation key is set, follow the detailed compilation steps found in the compilation.md file. This file includes all the necessary commands and instructions to successfully compile the admin system.
